True Grit is a classic American western novel by Charles Portis. It is about how a girl named Maddie Ross and a U.S. marshall named Rooster Cogburn, and a Texas Ranger named La Boeuf search out and kill a bandit named Tom Chaney. Chaney has killed Maddie's father, and she pays him 100 dollars in order to avenge his death.

It is set in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and a large amount of Southern language and anecdotes are used in the novel. If you don't appreciate Southern culture, this book may not be for you. However, this book is for you if you enjoy silly arguments, strange new ways of living that incorporate multiple cultures, and seeing news definitions of what it means to be a person.

This is not a peaceful time in Maddie's life. She is trying to avenge her father's death, and in the process becomes kidnapped by Lucky Ned Pepper. She is then cornered into a pit of rattlesnakes along with Chaney. There is a significant amount of shooting between the officers and the bandits. If you do not enjoy bits of violence, this is most definitely not a book for you.
